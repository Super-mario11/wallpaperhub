College Project
# This project is created using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

Step 1: Prepare XAMPP
Download and Install XAMPP:
If you don't have XAMPP installed, download it from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Start XAMPP Control Panel:
Open the XAMPP control panel and start the following services:

Apache (for running the PHP server)
MySQL (for the database)
Step 2: Add Project Files to XAMPP
Navigate to the htdocs folder:
Locate the htdocs folder inside your XAMPP installation directory. The default path is:

makefile
Copy code
C:\xampp\htdocs\
Create a New Folder for Your Project:
Inside the htdocs folder, create a new folder with the desired name (e.g., wallpaper_hub).

Add HTML, CSS, and PHP Files:
Copy all your project files (HTML, CSS, and PHP) into the newly created folder.

Step 3: Import the Database
Open phpMyAdmin:
In your web browser, go to the following URL:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
Create a New Database:

Click on the Databases tab.
Enter a name for your database (e.g., wallpaper_hub) and click Create.
Import the SQL File:

Select the newly created database.
Click on the Import tab.
Click Choose File and select the wallpaper_hub.sql file from your project folder.
Click Go to import the database.
Step 4: Access the Website
Open Your Web Browser:
In your web browser, go to the following URL:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost/Folder_Name/home.php
Replace Folder_Name with the actual name of the folder you created in htdocs (e.g., wallpaper_hub).

View Your Website:
The project should now be up and running locally!

Additional Notes
Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues with the database, make sure your MySQL service is running in the XAMPP control panel.
If the site does not load, double-check that the file paths are correct and that all necessary files are placed in the right directory.
This setup guide should help you get your College Project running locally using XAMPP. Happy coding! ðŸš€
